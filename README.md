This is MFP 7.1 based 1-day PoT path, that will allow you to get used to work with newest platform version within 1 day hands-on experience. During this day you will develop small banking app to check your cards balance & transactions and change limits. This app will be using Adapter-based authentication, Push notifications, MFP JS adapters, JSONStore and recently introduces cordova application project. Development will be done using Ionic Framework, MobileFirst Platform CLI and ATOM as main IDE.You will also learn how to use Mobile Quality Assurance service on Bluemix and report a bug inside the app. Your application development will start with creating a application using ionic command-line interface. Created project will be then moved to a MobileFirst platform cordova application project and you will continue development from there.

>Labs in this PoT are depending on each other, but you are able to skip some of them and continue afterwards by pulling source code from this repository branches, that is available separately for each lab. Just be careful with back-end services mocks that you need to create in labs 2.43, 2.46, 2.47
